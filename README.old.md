# shrub-club

## Description 

Shrub Club is an app that is similar to Tamagochi. 

he user has one Shrub that they can take care of by feeding, cleaning, chatting, and others. 

Distinct difference between shrub-club and other games (such as tamagochi, nintendogs, neopets, princess maker, and etc.) is that you can interact with your shrub with sentences. 

When you speak a sentence or words to the shrub and send it, it calculates the mood and applies to the shrub's happiness.
