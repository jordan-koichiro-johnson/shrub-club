# shrub-club

## Description 

Shrub Club is an app that is similar to Tamagochi.

The user has a "Shrub" that they can take care of by feeding, cleaning, chatting, and more. 

The distinct difference between Shrub-Club and other games (such as tamagochi, nintendogs, neopets, princess maker, etc.) is that you can interact with your shrub with verbal sentences.

When you speak a sentence or words to the shrub and send it, it calculates a reaction to the mood and applies it to the shrub's happiness.

## UserStory
